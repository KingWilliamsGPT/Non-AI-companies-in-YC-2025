The problem: conventional carbochlorination relies on purchasing carbon feedstocks, wastes valuable byproducts, and is highly CO\u2082-intensive.\r\n\r\nDuranium changes this with a novel reactor that recycles CO\u2082 emissions back into feedstock (CO) while generating a valuable co-product (bleaching agents).

The problem: conventional carbochlorination relies on purchasing carbon feedstocks, wastes valuable byproducts, and is highly CO\u2082-intensive.\r\n\r\nDuranium changes this with a novel reactor that recycles CO\u2082 emissions back into feedstock (CO) while generating a valuable co-product (bleaching agents). This closed loop slashes emissions and delivers Chinese-level metal pricing without subsidies \u2014 unlocking the full potential of carbochlorination for U.S. critical mineral production.",

F4 ensures design engineers never release noncompliant drawings\u2014and suppliers never misinterpret them. We help hardware teams eliminate costly scrap, rework, and miscommunication at the root.\r\n\r\nWith a compliant drawing, F4 generates end-to-end drawing interpretations for standard definitions, inspection plan, and tolerance analysis application.\r\n\r\nF4 automatically interprets all GD&T symbols, datums, and notes based on the correct standards - no more second-guessing or misreading intent. Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

                "value": "Built by former Tesla & SpaceX engineers, F4 is a platform that helps you catch and fix drawing compliance issues instantly. F4 ensures design engineers never release noncompliant drawings\u2014and suppliers never misinterpret them. We help hardware teams eliminate costly scrap, rework, and miscommunication at the root.\r\n\r\nWith a compliant drawing, F4 generates end-to-end drawing interpretations for standard definitions, inspection plan, and tolerance analysis application.\r\n\r\nF4 automatically interprets all GD&T symbols, datums, and notes based on the correct standards - no more second-guessing or misreading intent. Everyone from design to manufacturing sees the same definition, keeping teams aligned and avoiding costly miscommunication.\r\n\r\nF4 generates a complete inspection plan straight from the drawing, so quality teams know exactly what to measure, how, and where. This eliminates manual setup, reduces delays during first article inspection, and helps catch issues before they reach production.\r\n\r\nF4 gives engineers everything they need from the drawing to set up a reliable tolerance analysis, applicable features, and rule exceptions. By making it easy to bridge engineering drawings to tolerance analysis, teams can catch potential fit or function issues early - before parts are fabricated and assembled.\r\n",

Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5\u201310x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials \u2013 unlike fission \u2013 we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

                "value": "Maritime Fusion is building HTS (high-temperature superconducting) fusion reactors for defense and commercial shipping applications. Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5\u201310x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials \u2013 unlike fission \u2013 we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",
